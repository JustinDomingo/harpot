The Harry Potter Quiz is easy and the code starts off relatively simple. Whenever you click the correct answer, the browser sends an object to the server which is saved into an
array to track how much you get correct. After you receive your score, the app allows you to be able to submit it to a leaderboard. To be able to submit a score youi must
register for an account. The user registration is authenticated and validated through Node an MongoDB. Once validated, the registered user receives a session. There is also a
feature that allows you to post comments which get saved into a database.
